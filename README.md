# python-modules-talk
A talk to be given at the Django and Python meetup

## Blurb
Python is inherently modular, i.e. even basic data types can be
considered as objects.  Modules extend this idea to allow a program to
be thought of as a hierarchy of objects.  From a software design point
of view, entire Python programs can be turned into modules and be used
as such, in whole or in part.

This talk will cover some basics about Python modules as well as the
lessons learned from developing
[Shepherd](https://github.com/unixnut/cloud-support/tree/master/shepherd),
a modular tool for controlling a stable of hosts listed in an Ansible
inventory file.

A basic knowledge of Python programming would be helpful in
understanding this talk, but is not essential.

After viewing this talk, people should expect to be able to design (or
rewrite!) their programs and libraries in a highly modular fashion,
thereby making documentation, debugging and maintenance easier.
